# TidyData.txt description

This data set is a clean data from the data linked to from the course website wich represent data 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

 - The initial training and test data were merged to create one data set.
 - Then only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted.
 - The column with activity names was added
 - The column were named with more descriptive names
 - The final dataset contains tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The final data containes the columns:

- "subject"
 - "activity"
 - "activityname"
 - "timeBodyAccMeanX"
 - "timeBodyAccMeanY"
